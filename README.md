Download the music videos for the songs played in the weekly Top 18 from SiriusXM Alt Nation. The code should be easy enough to adjust to grab music from other SiriusXM channels.

After grabbing the song title and artist, search YT and take the first hit. Download the highest resolution I can, and save it. I then copy these over to a media folder on my plex server.

Bada bing, bada boom, my own personal MTV.
